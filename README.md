# Intrusion Detection and Displacement Monitoring from Video Sequence

  ## Introduction
 The implementation of intrusion detection module with YOLO network and displacement detection module with optical flow. More details about YOLO can be found on [You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640), about optical flow you may refer to [Optical flow on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow).
